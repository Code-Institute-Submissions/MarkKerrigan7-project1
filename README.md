Omagh Summer Football Camp For Kids
-
This is a website that I designed for a summer camp for children playing football. The site is targeted for adults that want to give their children something to do in the summer time.

Features
=
Navigation Bar - the navigation bar is placed at the top of the website with links to the About the Camp, Sign up and Contact Us scetions on the page.
The colour contrasts against the grey of the webpage and when hovered over the font changes to capital letters.
The navigation makes it clear to the user exactly what part of the page they will be taken too.

Header - the header has the name of the summer camp, done in a bright yellow font colour to contrast against the grey background of the page.
The header lets the user know that it is for all ages and skill levels.

About Us - the about us section tells the user all about the camp and everything that will be offered at it including when the camp is set to start, how long it will last etc.

Sign Up Form - this will allow the user of the site to sign their children up for the camp, with different age groups, a dropdown menu for gender and an area to let the coaches know about any injuries or ilnesses that their child may have.

Map - the map is used to show the location of the camp for the users benefit.

Social Media - the user can click on the icons at the bottom of the page and will be taken to the relevent social media site, with it opening in a new tab for easy navigation.

Testing
=
I have tested the website on Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari. I have tested the responsiveness and I am happy with how it looks across all devices.

All of my navigation links work, taking the user to the appropriate section of the webpage.

In my forms, i have included validation that is working perfectly, phone number requires a number and email address requires the proper layout.

No errors were returned when put through the html and css validators

My lighthouse scores are as follows: Performance 75, Accessibility 90, Best Practices 93, SEO 92

Deployment

My website was deployed to GitHub pages.

All content on the website is from myself, with the exception of the images and the map which i got from using google maps and used the embedding feature that they provide.

I got the image of the children playing football from "https://images.pexels.com/photos/6193967/pexels-photo-6193967.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=3&h=750&w=1260", the facebook logo i got from "https://cdn.freebiesupply.com/logos/large/2x/facebook-logo-2019.png" and the twitter logo from "https://www.designbust.com/download/635/png/twitter_logo_transparent_background512.png".
